# Revisions get collapsed in three instances:
# - A user has auto-saved: We clean previous old auto-saves
# - A user has saved: We clean up all auto-saves
# - A user has discarded changes: We revert the resource and remove old
#   auto-saves
#
# "Collapse" is how we refer to removing multiple revisions of auto save while
# persisting the cumulative changes. In practice it may mean we simply remove
# old versions and persist the original state.
#
# Papertrail saves the *original* state of the record. When we compare
# it in a diff, we want to compare the current state whether it's an autosave or
# update to the original state before auto-save started. The incremental changes
# can be discarded with out concern. Orignal <=> Current is what's important.
# Anytime the previous revision is an auto-save we want to carry the original
# state forward so we can always have it accessible to compare against. This
# happens when the new revision is an update, or autosave.
